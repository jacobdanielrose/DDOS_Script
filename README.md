#README
A simple DDOS script written in python. I am taking this from the guide given by 
Neural Nine which can be found here:

https://www.neuralnine.com/code-a-ddos-script-in-python/

Python is probably not the language of choice for a DDOS script but this script
is written for educational purposes and not for practical application. If one were
to use this in an actual setting, rewriting it in a compiled language or compiling the
python code into an .exe would be recommended.
